        description: 'Beloved Rapture is a narrative-driven indie game in the style of the “classic” role-playing games. It combines the best elements of a SNES-era RPGs (an immersive game world, tough puzzles, dungeons), with a more "cinematic" focus - akin to an Adventure Game. In its earliest form, the project originated all the way back in 2009 - but it was not until 2014/2015 that I pulled it out of hiatus, and truly redefined my overall vision for the game. I started recreating game from the ground-up.',
